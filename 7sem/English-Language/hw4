- Tailored Message

To connect with potential app users, I would use simple and clear language. I would focus on how easy the app is to use and how it can help save time and reduce stress. Instead of just listing features, I would share real stories from users who had success with the app. I would also mention any affordable pricing options or free trials to make them feel more comfortable trying it out. This way, I can match their values of being efficient and cost-effective while addressing their need for better organization and productivity.

3. Persuasive Tech in Action.

- Example: Apple Product Launch Event

During Apple’s product launch events, the communication is aimed at tech fans, people looking for high-quality products, and investors. The presentation often shows Apple’s strong brand and history of innovation (ethos). It uses facts and comparisons with other products (logos) and shares stories from users about how the products improve their lives (pathos). They repeat important words like "innovation" and "user experience" and use clear images to describe the products. Linking words like "furthermore," "in addition," and "therefore" help connect ideas, making it easier to understand. These techniques build trust and excitement, which helps increase interest in buying the products.

4. Linking Words in a Persuasive Text.

- Text: A Review of a New Smartphone

1. Furthermore: This word adds more information, showing that the smartphone has both advanced features and great design.
   
2. However: This word introduces a different view, pointing out some problems with the smartphone while keeping a fair perspective.

3. In addition: Like "furthermore," it adds more benefits, helping to explain why the smartphone is a good choice.

4. Therefore: This word shows a conclusion based on earlier points, supporting the idea that the smartphone is a good investment.

5. For instance: This phrase gives specific examples, making the message clearer and stronger.

These linking words help make the text clear and easy to follow. They connect ideas smoothly, making the argument stronger by ensuring that each point supports the last one, leading to a convincing conclusion.

Dr. Diaz: This week, we are discussing professional development, or workplace training. Some employees prefer to develop skills that will help them do their current job better. Others prefer to focus on training that helps them prepare for a better position int future. Which kinf of professional development opporltumities are more important for an employee to take adventage of? Why?

Chloe: It is far more important to focus on expanding skills that are relevant to your current job. By strengthening skills that can be put to use immediately, employees woll get themselves noticed by their managers and be able to quickly advance at the company.

Paul: Companies offer a variety of training programs, and employees should take whatever opportunity is given to then, even if id id not directly related to their job. Your never know when a better job opportunity will predent itself. Focusing oly on skills related to your current job will not nesessarily; make uou the vest candidate for a better position.

--------------------------------------------------
I think it is important for employees to have a balanced approach to their job development. Improving skills for their current job is very important for doing well and getting noticed. At the same time, it is also important to prepare for future job opportunities. When employees spend time on both areas, they can become more skilled and versatile.

For example, getting better at current job skills can help them get promotions quickly. Also, learning new skills for future jobs can make them strong candidates when new positions open up.

Dr.Gupta: Today, there is debate over how we should treat natural ecosystems, meaning wilderness areas that are basically untouched by huan activity. These natural ecosystems were once seen purely as resources to be expoited but many people now believe that wildermess areas should be proticted from any human use or interferemce so thst they continue developing completely naturally. To what extent do you support protection and preserbing natural exosustems? should some wildereness areas be totally protected from human use?

Andrew: People who are already struggling to feed their families are the ones most likely to be affected by, for example, a ban on mining in a wilderness area. We cannot prohibit human activities in natural exosystens without exonomic consequences. I elieve humans have a fundamental right to use natural resurces for survival and to build wealth.

Kelly: There are very few truly wild places left on Earth, and once they`re gone, we can never get them back. I believe we need to protect our remaining natural ecosystems from interference. Not only will the animals and plants in those places benefit, but so will humans because our own survival depends on the health of our planet.

--------------------------------------------------
In my opinion, it is very important to protect natural ecosystems for the health of the environment and for people. I understand that some people want to use resources from wild areas for economic reasons, but we need to remember that these ecosystems give us important things like clean air, water, and a variety of plants and animals that support human life.

Keeping these areas safe helps nature grow, which can bring benefits like eco-friendly tourism and new medicines. Also, protecting ecosystems helps fight climate change, which is a big problem that affects everyone, especially those in need.

I think we need a balanced plan: we can protect some areas while allowing careful use of others. This way, we can meet human needs without harming our planet. In conclusion, protecting natural ecosystems is not just important for the environment; it is also necessary for our survival and well-being.

Training:
First, I think that boarding school it is very good place. For example it is better place for socialization students, for study them to work in command and create groupes of people with strong connectivity. However this place must has comfortable conditions that students can concentrate on studing. Because if this is not the case, then such learning will turn into a problem from which students will want to run away as quickly as possible.
