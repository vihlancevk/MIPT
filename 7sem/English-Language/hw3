How do you get what you want using just your words? Aristotle set out to answer exactly that question over 2,000 years ago with a treatise on rhetoric. Rhetoric, according to Aristotle, is the art of seeing the available means of persuasion. And today, we apply it to any form of communication. Aristotle focused on oration, though. And he described three types of persuasive speech. Forensic or judicial rhetoric establishes facts and judgments about the past, similar to detectives at a crime scene. Epidictic or demonstrative rhetoric makes a proclamation about the present situation, as in wedding speeches. But the way to accomplish change is through deliberative rhetoric or symboleticon. Rather than the past or the present, deliberative rhetoric focuses on the future. It’s the rhetoric of politicians debating a new law by imagining what effect it might have. Like when Ronald Reagan warned that the introduction of Medicare would lead to a socialist future spent telling our children and our children’s children what it once was like in America when men were free. But it’s also the rhetoric of activists urging change, such as Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream that his children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. In both cases, the speakers present their audience with a possible future and try to enlist their help in avoiding or achieving it. But what makes for good deliberative rhetoric besides the future tense? According to Aristotle, there are three persuasive appeals, ethos, logos, and pathos. Ethos is how you convince an audience of your credibility. Winston Churchill began his 1941 address to the U.S. Congress by declaring, I have been in full harmony all my life with the tides which have flowed on both sides of the Atlantic against privilege and monopoly, thus highlighting his virtue as someone committed to democracy. Much earlier, in his defense of the poet Archaeus, Roman consul Cicero appealed to his own practical ethical wisdom, and expertise as a politician, drawn from my study of the liberal sciences and from that careful training to which I admit that at no part of my life I have ever been disinclined. And finally, you can demonstrate disinterest, or that you’re not motivated by personal gain. Logos is the use of logic and reason. This method can employ rhetorical devices such as analogies, examples, and citations of research or statistics. But it’s not just facts and figures. It’s also the structure and content of the speech itself. The point is to use factual knowledge to convince the audience, as in Sojourner Truth’s argument for women’s rights. I have as much muscle as any man and can do as much work as any man. I have plowed and reaped and husked and chopped and mowed, and can any man do more than that? Unfortunately, speakers can also manipulate people with false information that the audience thinks is true, such as the debunked but still widely believed claim that vaccines cause autism. And finally, pathos appeals to emotion, and in our age of mass media, it’s often the most effective mode. Pathos is neither inherently good nor bad, but it may be irrational and unpredictable. It can just as easily rally people for peace as incite them to war. Car. Most advertising, from beauty products that promise to relieve our physical insecurities to cars that make us feel powerful, relies on pathos. Aristotle’s rhetorical appeals still remain powerful tools today. But deciding which of them to use is a matter of knowing your audience and purpose, as well as the right place and time. And perhaps just as important is being able to notice when these same methods of persuasion are being used on you.

1) Key Concepts Check:
- Three Fundamental Appeals According to Aristotle

1. Ethos: This appeal focuses on the credibility and character of the speaker. It establishes trust and authority.
   - Example from the text: Winston Churchill highlights his commitment to democracy to establish credibility.
   - Personal Example: When I present a project at work, I often share my relevant experience and qualifications to build trust with my audience.

2. Logos: This appeal uses logic and reasoning, often incorporating facts, statistics, and structured arguments.
   - Example from the text: Sojourner Truth uses logical reasoning in her argument for women’s rights by citing her physical capabilities.
   - Personal Example: In a debate about renewable energy, I might present data on cost savings and environmental benefits to logically support my stance.

3. Pathos: This appeal targets the emotions of the audience, aiming to evoke feelings that influence their response.
   - Example from the text: The emotional rhetoric used by Martin Luther King Jr. evokes a vision of a better future based on equality.
   - Personal Example: In a charity event, sharing a personal story about someone who benefited from the organization can evoke empathy and encourage donations.

- What is "Framing" in the Context of Persuasion?

The way information is presented to influence perception and interpretation, shaping how an issue is understood.

- How it works: By framing an issue in a particular way, speakers can guide the audience's thoughts and feelings. For example, referring to a tax increase as an "investment in public services" rather than a "burden on taxpayers" can lead to more favorable perceptions of the policy.

- Why is it Important to Understand the Audience You Are Trying to Persuade?

Understanding your audience is crucial for effective persuasion because it allows you to tailor your message to resonate with their values, beliefs, and emotions. Different audiences respond to different appeals—ethos, logos, and pathos.

- How Can Understanding Persuasive Techniques Help Us to Be More Critical Consumers of Information?

Recognizing the use of ethos, logos, and pathos enables consumers to:

1. Identify Manipulation.
2. Evaluate Credibility.
3. Analyze Arguments.
4. Make Informed Decisions.

2) Identifying Rhetorical Devices:

- Rhetorical Devices

1. Anaphora
   - Definition: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses or sentences.
   - Example: In Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, he repeatedly begins several sentences with "I have a dream," emphasizing his vision for the future.

2. Antithesis
   - Definition: A contrast or opposition between two things, often expressed in parallel structure.
   - Example: In his famous speech, John F. Kennedy said, "Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country." This juxtaposition highlights the contrast between self-interest and civic duty.

3. Rhetorical Questions
   - Definition: A question posed for effect rather than to elicit an answer, often used to engage the audience or provoke thought.
   - Example: In Sojourner Truth's speech, she might ask, "Ain't I a woman?" This question challenges the audience to consider their assumptions about gender and race.

- Additional Rhetorical Devices

4. Pathos
   - Definition: An appeal to emotion, aiming to evoke feelings in the audience.
   - Example: Advertisements that show heartwarming stories or sad situations to promote charitable giving rely heavily on pathos.

5. Logos
   - Definition: An appeal to logic and reason, using facts, statistics, and logical arguments.
   - Example: A speaker might present data showing the benefits of renewable energy sources compared to fossil fuels to persuade the audience of their efficacy.

6. Ethos
   - Definition: An appeal to credibility or character, convincing the audience of the speaker's reliability or moral authority.
   - Example: Winston Churchill's reference to his lifelong commitment to democracy establishes his ethos as a trustworthy leader.

- Finding Examples in Texts

To find examples of these rhetorical devices in any persuasive text or video, look for:

- Anaphora: Repeated phrases at the start of sentences.
- Antithesis: Contrasting ideas presented in a balanced manner.
- Rhetorical Questions: Questions that don’t require an answer but provoke thought.
- Pathos: Emotional language or imagery that stirs feelings.
- Logos: Logical arguments supported by evidence.
- Ethos: References to the speaker’s qualifications or moral character.
